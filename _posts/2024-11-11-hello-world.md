# Hello, World! Across 7 Languages

Welcome, explorers of code! 🌍 No programming journey is complete without the humble "Hello, World!"—the program equivalent of saying "Hi, I'm here!" in a new language. Today, let's go global and check out "Hello, World!" across seven different programming languages. Here’s to the thrill of our first print statement!

## C

Ah, C! The backbone of many systems. Here’s how C says "Hello, World!"

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

C#

C# makes it look easy with a few lines, using its .NET framework.

using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Ruby

Ruby keeps it simple and sweet. This line is as minimal as it gets!

puts "Hello, World!"

Go

Go is strong and opinionated, yet concise. Here’s “Hello, World!” in Go:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

Node.js

JavaScript running on a server? Absolutely! Here’s how you do it with Node.js:

console.log("Hello, World!");

Python

Python’s syntax is famously beginner-friendly. Here’s its take:

print("Hello, World!")

Rust

Rust is both powerful and safe. It keeps you on your toes but welcomes you warmly:

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}

And there you have it! Seven languages, seven greetings, one universal message: “Hello, World!” Whatever language you choose, each first program reminds us of the wonder and creativity in programming. So, which one is your favorite “Hello, World!”?

Happy coding! 😃

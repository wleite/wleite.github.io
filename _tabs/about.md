## Who am I

I bring years of experience leading large-scale IT projects, from ERP and cloud applications to AI/ML solutions, driving digital transformation in complex environments. My work has focused on effective budgeting and governance for corporate projects, leveraging frameworks like PMI and CMMI to ensure successful implementation.

I’ve managed senior IT service contracts, particularly in outsourcing, where I prioritize delivering practical, high-value solutions. I enjoy building and supporting strong technical teams with a focus on architecture and infrastructure, and I’m committed to fostering productive relationships with clients, partners, and suppliers.

My background includes hands-on responsibility for software development, support, and maintenance, with a focus on agile team structures and DevOps for process automation and security. I’m experienced in the complete software lifecycle, including quality assurance, testing, and release management.
